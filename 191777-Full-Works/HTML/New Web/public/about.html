    <h2 class="h1">The colleges and halls</h2>
    <p class="about">There are 39 Oxford colleges, which are financially independent and self-governing, but relate to
        the central University in a kind of federal system. There are also six permanent private halls, which are
        similar to colleges except that they tend to be smaller, and were founded by particular Christian denominations.
        The colleges and halls are close academic communities, which bring together students and researchers from
        different disciplines, cultures and countries. This helps to foster the outstanding research achievement that
        has made Oxford a leader in so many fields.

        The colleges and the University work together to organise teaching and research, and many staff at Oxford will
        hold both a college and a University post.

        If you are interested in undergraduate study at Oxford, please consult our information on colleges for
        prospective undergraduates. </p>
    <h2 class="h2">The Central University</h2>
    <p class="para1">
        The central University is made up of many different sections, including academic and administrative departments,
        libraries and museums.

        There are roughly 100 major academic departments, which are overseen by the four academic divisions: Medical
        Sciences; Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences; Humanities and Social Sciences.

        Each department organises teaching and research in a different subject area, from Anthropology to Zoology. There
        are also many smaller, specialist research centres and sub-departments.

        The Department for Continuing Education offers part-time, flexible courses and programmes for adult learners. It
        offers more than 1,000 courses each year, including weekly classes, online courses, day, weekend and summer
        schools, undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications, and continuing professional development courses.
